# CS 348 Project – Milestone 0

### 🎵 **TuneMatch: A Music-Based Matching App (WIP)**

We’re building **TuneMatch**, a simple app that connects people based on their music taste.

### 🧰 Tech Stack (planned):

* **MySQL** for the database
* **Flask** for the backend
* **Next.js** for the frontend

### 📊 Sample Dataset

Just a basic test setup for now — a `Users` table with a few sample names and favorite artists (e.g., Alice likes Taylor Swift). Helps us connect the stack end-to-end.

### ⚙️ Setup Plan

* MySQL database will store user info
* Flask API will fetch that data
* Next.js frontend will display it

### ✅ Current Progress

We’ll start with a "Hello World" full-stack app to test the flow. This will set the foundation for the real matching logic and music features later on.
